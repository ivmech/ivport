Raspberry Pi Camera Module Multiplexer by [Ivmech Mechatronics](http://www.ivmech.com)

IVPORT which is the first Raspberry Pi (also Raspberry Pi A,A+,B+ and Raspberry Pi 2 fully compatible) Camera Module multiplexer is designed to make possible connecting more than one camera module to single CSI camera port on Raspberry Pi. Multiplexing can be controlled by 3 pins for 4 camera modules, 5 pins for 8 camera modules and 9 pins for **maximum up to 16 camera modules** with using GPIO.

IVPort has already been shipped to **55 countries** and **30 universities** with over **300 users**.

IVPort can be used for stereo vision with stereo camera.

### Updated Notes

### [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4JZN7Y0d2o) of stereo recording with 2 camera modules

The closest approach to **simultaneous capturing** at **640x480 resolution with 7 fps** each camera connected to Ivport Camera Multiplexer (4 camera boards were connected.) by utilizing Raspberry Pi's video-capture capabilities with a JPEG encoder. See more details [here](https://github.com/ivmech/ivport/wiki/Capture-Sequence).

**Revision 3 Boards are available with better compatibility and image quality.**
Revision 3 board has differential pair signals' better routing therefore image quality improvement.
Revision 1 had some unintended design failures and manufacturing mistakes therefore enhancements and fixes were added to Revision 2 board. Please feel free to contact us if there is any issue on Revision 1 ivport boards.

### IVPORT DUAL is available at [HERE](http://www.ivmech.com/magaza/en/development-modules-c-4/ivport-dual-raspberry-pi-camera-module-multiplexer-p-104).
**IVPORT DUAL is Lite version of IVPORT for only 2 Camera Modules**
